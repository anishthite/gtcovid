## Georgia Tech Coronavirus Tracking

So I've been following http://health.gatech.edu/coronavirus/health-alerts to see how safe campus is, but it's kinda hard to actually see what's going on simply from the tables.
Let's vizualize it!
(Note these charts are automatically updated every 12 hours)

### New Cases

An intuitive way to gauge contagiousness on campus is by looking at the new daily new cases:

It's a bit noisy so we can smooth it out. Here's a 3-day moving average, as well as a weekly tally:

### Campus Impact






I'll be updating this later with more charts...
