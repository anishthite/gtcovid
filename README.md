## Georgia Tech Coronavirus Tracking

So I've been following http://health.gatech.edu/coronavirus/health-alerts to see how safe campus is, but it's kinda hard to actually see what's going on simply from the tables.
Let's vizualize it!
(Note these charts are automatically updated every 12 hours)

### New Cases

An intuitive way to gauge contagiousness on campus is by looking at the new daily new cases:

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/anishthite/gtcovid/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
